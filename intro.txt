I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from SRM University, India. I'm primarily a Full stack Developer but I'm flexible enough to work across teams and pick up any new technologies and languages. I see myself as a problem solver and I'm looking to rapidly advance my skills as a well rounded software engineer. I have a fairly good Functional Programming background, learning and working in languages like Scala, Haskell, Elm and Rust, as well as coaching myself on Type Theory from time to time. Also I'm a big Javascript Geek having survived through the infamous JS Fatigue.

My experience at Indix
After having interned at two other companies during the Summer, I was hired by Indix at my University's Campus Recruitment. I was asked to write a blog post about my whole experience. Here it is.

After the new hire bootcamp, I opted to work for the Engineering Tools Team. I started out with adding features, bug fixes and writing Python scripts for the Customer Success Team. It wasn't long before I got to work on new projects.

Despite my lack of professional experience when I first started out, my Team Lead trusted me enough in letting me own and work end-to-end on the development (Balsamiq Mockups to Design/Architecture to Deployment) of a complex non-trivial project and taking it to Production.

The project involved developing a web-based tool that would be used to outsource the data ingestion workflow activities for automated focused crawling by means of tagging the website through mouse actions, similar to ParseHub but covering Indix's Platform specific usecases. The web application was written in React/Redux, RxJS. The core part of the application was written in Scala and a Play Service wrapper around it.

During my time there, I also wrote an open source node library that has been downloaded over 5000 times on NPM. https://github.com/ind9/web-auto-extractor

What Iâ€™m looking to do next
I've just moved to NYC this month (August). I'm primarily a Full Stack Developer but I'm flexible enough to work across teams and pick up any new technologies and languages. Looking for an opportunity where I can improve and advance my career and skills as a T shaped Developer, getting a chance to work on a broad range of technologies from Mobile to Graphics to Data. I also deeply value Company Culture.
