                          My full name is Lourdes Roashan. I come from a beautiful city called 'Chennai' from the southern part of India. 
                          I was first introduced to technology when my dad got me the old Nintendo where 
                          I played 8-bit games like Super Mario Bros and the likes.
                          Going ahead, I got naturally competitive as I grew up with an older brother, 
                          who occasionally challenged me to a game of chess. Growing up, I spent most of my time playing with puzzles,
                          doing DIY stuff with cardboards and glue, tinkering with RC cars, drawing and painting. I occasionally enjoyed
                          reading comics and watching Anime. At 14 years old, I welcomed my first Personal Computer(PC) home. Back then, my
                          idea was to use it to play games, but soon after I discovered the existence of the internet, a new realm opened up.
                          The curiousity about how games worked, how a machine could play against a human, the world of programming, the ability to make
                          things from a few lines of code piqued my interest, which would soon become an obsession and eventually leading me to earn a major
                          in Computer Science.

                              I earned my Bachelors degree in Computer Science in 2015. Solved classical problems from SPOJ and HackerRank. Built several side-projects for me as well as for my university using MySQL,PHP, HTML/CSS. I helped my university build and maintain web applications
                              for their technical symposium within the department of computer science. Evolved to a full stack JavaScript centric role. Built smooth and feature rich web apps with NodeJS and AngularJS.
                              I also took some interest in Data Science and built a twitter sentiment analysis model as my senior year project. After graduating in 2015, I joined SAP Labs India as and worked for two years
                              building infrastructure for the SAP Hybris C4C. Responsible for contributing to the internal ODATA framework.

                                    I'm an open source enthusiast and I support the open source community. It is because of such communities that
                                    I have learnt so much about programming. Also, though I'm ideally a full-stack developer, I keep in touch with 
                                    Data Structures and Algorithms as they are the foundation and building blocks of programming. I have a 'Silver 3-star Problem Solving Badge' from HackerRank.
                                    To sum it up, I'm a developer by day, programmer by night, and a 24/7 learner.
